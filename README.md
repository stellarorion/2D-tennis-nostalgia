# 2D-tennis-nostalgia
a Pong like game.

## Description

- This is my first video game created in Lua with the LÃ–VE framework.
- This game was created by following a YouTube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1A1gsSe2tMzxf54D1OooafEnADpjZlP7) by DevJeeper.
- The code is practically identical with DevJeeper's. I only added a few cosmetic changes.

## Controls

- "W" for up
- "S" for down
